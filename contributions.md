| Feb 3   | link to my contribution    | course website    |   I fixed a broken link.    |
| Apr 6  | [wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Saldanaj27)  |  Wikipedia   |   I added multiple contributions to the wiki of a former head coach of the USC football team. I was trying to figure out how to add hyper links which is why there are multiple small contributions to his wiki. |
| Apr 9  | [wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Saldanaj27)  |  Wikipedia   |   I added a sentence about the 2021 USC football season. I wrote it but then realized I wasn't logged in so I made a minor edit to the sentence I added. |
| Apr 10 | [wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lincoln_Riley&oldid=1082002472) | Wikipedia | I added a few sentences about the former Oklahoma football head coach including information on the amount of former NFL players he has coached. I went through previous history of the teams to grab that information. |
| Apr 17 | [openStreetMap edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/119835027#map=13/34.1189/-118.2261) | openStreetMap | I added the restaurant hours of one of my favorite chinese restaurants back home. |
| Apr 19 | [openStreetMap edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/119929038) | openStreetMap | I added the restaurant hours and the address for a popular chicken and waffles place (Roscoe's) in Los Angeles. |
| May 1 | [openStreetMap edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/120432968) | openStreetMap | I fixed the market hours for the trader joes on Spring St. I saw it said it closed at 10 pm which was not correct |
| May 1 | [wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lincoln_Riley&oldid=1085663285) | Wikipedia | With this contribution, I actually updated my previous contribution. I had talked about how this head coach had produced 21 draft picks and was to add more onto that list after the 2022 season. I updated it to add 7 more draft picks as the 2022 NFL Draft was on April 28 - 30 |
| May 3 | [openStreetMap edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/120509868) |
openStreetMap | The Peruvian restaurant was said to be a Japanese Restaurant and also closed (because of the pandemic) so I changed the restaurant to its correct cuisine while removing that it is closed and placed the actual restaurant hours |
