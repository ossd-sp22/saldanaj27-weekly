The git activity this lecture was a refresher for me as I have worked with git for so long. The forking of a repository was very simple for me, but I have always needed to remind myself how to use a repository that is upstream. I also used a lot of git commands during this activity that I rarely, if ever, use such as 'git remote' or 'git log.' I wasn't sure what they did to be honest. I am aware of 'git status,' but I add and commit changes right after making such changes that I don't need to check what files I changed. The activity was really helpful and I like practicing more git.

I was not able to attend the lecture where Jim Hall was lecturing. Unfortunately, I had a COVID exposure and thought it was best to stay home.
