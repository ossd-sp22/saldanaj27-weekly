My project mates and I decided to create an extension that modeled another extension we were a fan of. This extension I am speaking of is called Wii Music Extension. It would play the Wii song whenever you are on a shopping website such as Amazon.com. It was extremely amusing to us all, so we wanted to recreate it with a little twist. Since we were in the season of Valentine's Day we wanted to create an extension that would play a Marvin Gaye's song whenever you are in the Valentine's Day History Channel website. There would be a pop-up on the top right where you can play or pause the music.

My contributions to this extension was connecting the song to the extension and making sure the play/pause button would work on the History Channel website. I tried modeling the extension we were inspired by but they connected the audio through an unknown method. I ended up using something simpler.

I did, however, use the audio library for the first time which was something I never used. I had to use StackOverflow for most of the time because I had no idea how to use it.
