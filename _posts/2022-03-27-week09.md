### The Beginning
My project mates and I had a few ideas of what project we would like to work on. We used the class time to finalize our decision by going through all the options and seeing which project we are drawn to most. We realized that some repositiories were not as active so those projects were out of question and some seemed to need help with issues that were out of our skill level in languages we weren't fond of. We then settled on the California government's design system. This open source project is trying to connect the citizens of California to services across the state all in one website. We have reached out to the repo and have already scheduled a meeting with the technical lead and design lead!
